# Building the Features Section

</br>

# Topics

- How to include and use an icon font.

- Another way of creating the "skewed" section" design.

- How and when to use the direct child selector.

So, in this section we have four columns, each with a box.

When we hover, we have this effect that skews the element.

And then in each of these boxes, we have the four features of this company, and then below that is the text.

On the top center of the box, there's an icon with a gradient, just like the one used for the heading in the "About" section.

#### Icons

[LINEA: Free Icon sets](https://linea.io/)
Can download all the icon sets for free from linea.io

Unzip the file, inside the folder, _basic directory, we will be using the _ICONFONT directory.
Inside _ICONFONT, we want to copy the "fonts" folder and the "styles.css" and paste them to our project's CSS directory.
